# Authentication

The file in this directory adds authentication specific helpers, including the ability to retrieve the
current user's authentication state, the ability to login via AJAX request, and the handlers that are
called in the header ([see header docs](/blocks/header/README.md)) to update any view elements based
on the user's authenticated state.
